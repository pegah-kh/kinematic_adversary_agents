what is the cost at each step of the simulation? along with the 

the cost at simulation step $i$ wrt the throttle at simulation step $j$. 


like plot the two of them: the cost at each step of the simulation and the throttle at each step of the simulation to understand how it should change
but not from the cost we understand the direction of the
